# #obsidian 1.12.2 Modpack

This modpack is by and for the **#obsidian Research** community. It's a kitchen-sink-y modpack with focus on Technology, Automation, Magic and Building, as per our interests. A list of mods can be found [here](packs/obsidian12pack.voodoo.kts) - sorted and annotated!

We use the modpack development tool [Voodoo](https://github.com/DaemonicLabs/Voodoo) for easier development, version control, management of mods, keeping them up-to-date, and to have a self-updating MultiMC instance for our players.

## Download and Installation

Simply drag this link >> [`obsidian12pack.zip`](https://meowface.org/copygirl/obsidian12pack.zip) << and drop it into the main [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) window to create a new instance. On first launch, an error will likely appear; in this case just launch it again. It will then ask you which optional mods you want and download everything for you before starting the game.

If you want to create a new singleplayer world, we recommend the "Lost Cities (BoP)" world type, for which we've created a custom profile. Alternatively, set these options in the `server.properties` if you're creating your own server:

```ini
level-type=lostcities_bop
generator-settings={"profile"\:"custom"}
```

If you'd like to play on the official server, feel free to poke @copygirl.
