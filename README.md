# #obsidian 1.12.2 Modpack

This modpack is by and for the **#obsidian Research** community. It's a kitchen-sink-y modpack with focus on Technology & Automation, Magic and Building, as per our interests. Our list of mods can be found [here](packs/obsidian12pack.voodoo.kts) - sorted and annotated!

## Download and Installation

We use [Voodoo](https://github.com/DaemonicLabs/Voodoo) for easier modpack development, keeping mods up-to-date and to have a self-updating [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) instance for our players.

Simply drag this link >> [`obsidian12pack.zip`](https://meowface.org/copygirl/obsidian12pack.zip) << and drop it into the MultiMC window to create a new instance. You might have to start it up twice. Then it will ask you which optional mods you want and download everything for you.

If you want to create a new singleplayer world, we recommend the *Lost Cities (BoP)* world type and created a custom profile for it. If you're creating your own server, set these options in the `server.properties`:

```ini
level-type=lostcities_bop
generator-settings={"profile"\:"custom"}
```

If you'd like to play on the official server, feel free to ask copygirl.
